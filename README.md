# BIMCloudBasicBackupScript

Unfortunatly BIMCloud Basic has no backup option included.

That is why I wrote my own script, based on the v24 backupscript from Graphisoft:
http://dl.graphisoft.com/ftp/techsupport/documentation/BIMcloud_Backup_Guide/v24PcServerAndManagerBk...

 

I was unable to find a newer version for v25 or v26.
But my script should work with the these.
